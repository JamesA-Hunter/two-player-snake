# two-player-snake
Following my javascript snake clone i am rebuilding it using React, tailwind css, Node and using websockets with socket.io

# to-do
- once game is setup allow players to ready up, let the other player know that the other has readied up
- create visual representation of game on client
- create socket.io event emitters client side and create handlers server side
